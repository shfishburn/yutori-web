**Yutori Labs: Pulse Sensors**  
One sensor platform, three ways to turn heat and cold into a measurable practice.

## Hero

**Instrument your rituals, not just your step count**

Pulse Sensors are small Bluetooth sensors plus the Yutori app that upgrade any sauna or cold plunge you already own. Pick sauna, plunge, or both, and get live temperature, automatic session logging, HR/HRV integration, coaching, and an emergency‑aware safety layer.

## How it works

- **Sensor in the environment** – A RuuviTag Pro–class sensor measures temperature (plus humidity for sauna) at the point your body actually experiences it. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/146956071/796a734d-2f0d-4851-bf88-84c9ac432fde/ruuvitag-tech-spec-2023-04.pdf)
- **App on your phone + watch** – Yutori reads sensor data over Bluetooth, pulls HR and HRV from Apple Health, and turns each heat or cold round into a structured session.

- **Coach in the background** – Live Coach builds personal timing windows, watches heart‑rate and temperature guardrails, and logs trends over weeks, with optional multi‑week protocols and an emergency‑alert workflow. [ascopubs](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.8544)

Same hardware, same app—just pointed at heat, cold, or both.
