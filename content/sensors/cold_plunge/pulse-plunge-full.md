# Yutori Labs: Pulse Plunge

**A hand‑crafted asnaro cold tub that turns deliberate cold exposure into a calm, measurable practice.**

---

## A Japanese cold tub for your backyard

Pulse Plunge is a deep, single‑person Japanese ofuro, hand‑built in asnaro (Hiba) and designed specifically for outdoor cold‑water use. Asnaro's tight grain and natural resins make it more resistant to rot and checking than soft hinoki, while still carrying the subtle, resinous scent associated with traditional bathhouses.

- Approx. **56" L × 30" W × 26–28" H** exterior (≈1400 × 760 × 680–720 mm).  
- Deep geometry for seated, chin‑to‑neck immersion with bent knees.  
- Clean interior with no molded seats or plastic inserts—just warm, smooth wood.  

It's a dedicated room for cold, scaled to live beside Pulse Sauna or as a stand‑alone ritual.

## Asnaro: built to live outdoors

Bartok‑crafted asnaro tubs are tuned for real‑world use, not just showroom photography.

- **Outdoor‑ready durability** – Asnaro has higher natural resistance to decay, insects, and long‑term water exposure than soft hinoki, making it better suited for frequent filling and draining outside.  
- **Warm, understated look** – Pale golden wood that harmonizes with your clear‑cedar Pulse Sauna without trying to match every board.  
- **Traditional construction** – Thick asnaro staves, stainless/brass hardware where needed, smooth interior surfaces, and simple, rectilinear lines that feel timeless.

You get Japanese craft with materials chosen for the way you'll actually use it.

## Why no chiller?

Pulse Plunge is intentionally passive: a hand‑built asnaro tub plus a sensor and app, not a noisy machine.

### Less complexity, more reliability

Chillers add pumps, fans, compressor noise, plumbing, and new failure points. By keeping Pulse Plunge as a passive tub, you get quieter operation and fewer things to maintain or repair.

### "Cold enough" for meaningful adaptation

Most people experience strong subjective and autonomic responses in the **45–60 °F (7–15 °C)** range. In many climates—especially with shade, overnight cooling, and occasional ice—this is achievable without mechanical chilling. The Yutori app tracks the actual water temperature and adjusts timing and coaching to the conditions you have, not an industrial setpoint.

### Better alignment with traditional ofuro philosophy

Traditional Japanese ofuro are heated, not chilled, and treated as a ritual rather than a precisely controlled system. We preserve that simplicity: a tub you fill, cool naturally, and step into, with the app documenting your practice instead of micromanaging hardware.

### Future flexibility

Your chiller options and your tub are decoupled. If you later want mechanical chilling, you can add any third‑party chiller system and use Pulse Plunge as the vessel; the sensor and app will still see the actual water temperature.

## Water management: practical guidance

Without integrated filtration or chilling, treat Pulse Plunge like a **high‑end soaking tub**, not a permanent pool.

### Recommended water‑change cadence

- **Daily use (1–2 people, once per day)**  
  Change water every **2–4 days**, depending on temperature, shade, and hygiene discipline.  
  
- **Heavy use (multiple users, frequent guests)**  
  Plan on **daily or every‑other‑day** changes to keep water clear and odor‑free.

**Signs it's time to change sooner:**  
- Persistent cloudiness or surface film.  
- Noticeable odor.  
- Visible debris that doesn't skim away easily.

This is more conservative than some Japanese home practices, where families keep water in a hot ofuro for longer by everyone soaping and rinsing thoroughly before entering and by heating the same water repeatedly. Those setups combine high starting temps, smaller volumes, and cultural discipline around pre‑washing that many Western users do not replicate.

For a cold, outdoor tub in North America with leaves, pollen, and casual use, short, regular water changes are the safer default.

### How to extend water life between changes

If you want to stretch the interval without turning the tub into a pool:

- **Pre‑shower rule**  
  Make "rinse off first" part of the ritual to keep sweat, skin oils, and sunscreen out of the tub. This is standard practice in Japan and makes a noticeable difference in water clarity.

- **Shade and cover**  
  Keep the tub shaded where possible and use a fitted wooden or insulated cover when not in use. This reduces UV‑driven algae growth, organic debris, and temperature swings.

- **Simple skimming and rinsing**  
  Use a small hand skimmer after sessions to remove leaves or insects. Rinse interior surfaces with fresh water before refilling, squeegeeing down as needed.

- **Light spa‑style sanitation (optional)**  
  For clients who insist on keeping water longer, a very light, spa‑grade treatment regime (e.g., low‑dose hydrogen peroxide or similar non‑chlorine oxidizer) following manufacturer guidance is an option—but this shifts the tub into "managed water chemistry" territory and is at the user's discretion.

We deliberately do not integrate filtration or chemical systems; instead, we keep the hardware simple and lean on reasonable hygiene plus periodic water changes.

## Instrumented with Pulse Plunge Sensor

Every Pulse Plunge ships with a Pulse Plunge Sensor (RuuviTag Pro–class) and the Yutori mobile app.

### Live water temperature

- Submerged Bluetooth sensor reports water temperature in real time to your phone (and Apple Watch if you use it).  
- Sensor operating range −40 to 85 °C (−40 to 185 °F) with IP68/IP69K housing handles ice baths, splashes, and hose‑downs.  
- You see exactly how cold the water is—not just "about mid‑40s."

### Automatic plunge logging

- Each plunge is captured with:  
  - Duration.  
  - Start, end, and complete water‑temperature curve.  
  - Peak heart rate and HRV change when paired with a compatible wearable via Apple Health or other connectors.  
- Sessions can be written into Apple Health as workouts, visible alongside runs, rides, and sleep data.

### How the app supports "no chiller" operation

- **Temperature tracking and session context**  
  The app logs water temperatures across days, so you can see how overnight cooling and ice additions change your environment and adjust your session length rather than chasing a fixed number.

- **Usage‑based reminders**  
  Add usage‑based prompts (e.g., "You've done X sessions on this fill; consider refreshing the water") so you don't have to remember manually.

- **Protocol flexibility**  
  The coach doesn't assume a precise temperature; it understands zones and adjusts recommended timing based on the water you actually have.

## Yutori Coach: structure and safety for cold

Pulse Plunge includes **lifetime Yutori Premium** for this tub's owner, so all cold and contrast‑coaching features are unlocked from day one.

### During each plunge

- Detects modality ("cold plunge" or part of a contrast block), elapsed time, water temperature, heart rate, and HRV.  
- Builds a **personal cold‑exposure window** by combining:  
  - Your recent cold sessions (time and temperature).  
  - The current water‑temperature zone (e.g., "cool", "cold", "very cold").  
  - Demographic factors (age, sex, height, weight) to bias toward more conservative dosing when warranted.  
- Watches **guardrails**:  
  - Heart‑rate ceiling at ≈85% of age‑predicted max.  
  - "Danger" cold zones where hypothermia risk rises quickly.  
  - Hard maximum durations for cold sessions.  
- Surfaces simple states—"short primer dip", "strong but reasonable round", or "time to get out"—instead of pushing you toward extremes.

If you own a Pulse Sauna plus Pulse Sauna Sensor, Yutori also treats alternating hot and cold as a single **contrast session**, adjusting timing and commentary to where you are in the cycle.

### Over weeks and months

The same data feed into:

- Average plunge duration and your typical temperature range.  
- "Cold‑shock" peak heart rate early vs later in your practice.  
- How long you can stay at a given temperature while staying within guardrails.

A Supabase‑hosted analysis service then produces:

- Short summaries and metric‑linked insights (for example, "your average time at 50–55 °F increased from 60 to 120 seconds over 8 weeks").  
- Optional multi‑week cold‑only and contrast protocols with suggested temperatures, durations, weekly frequency, benchmarks, and safety notes.

### Safety net

Pulse Plunge participates in the Yutori safety system:

- Customizable timers, prompts, and emergency contacts.  
- If the system detects a concerning pattern (unusual duration plus lack of interaction plus worrisome vitals), it can escalate: stronger local alerts, notifying your chosen contacts, and—where supported—initiating an emergency‑call workflow via your device.

This depends on your phone, sensors, and network, and should be treated as a **backup layer**, not a medical monitor or a substitute for supervision.

## Site, use, and integration

Pulse Plunge is designed to sit beside Pulse Sauna or in its own outdoor corner.

- **Placement**: Level, well‑drained pad (pavers or concrete) sized to the tub with space to step in and out; grade sloped so splash and rinse water can move away from the base.  
- **Water**: Fill‑and‑refresh cold tub; use with ambient well/city water, ice, or pre‑chilled water if you have a separate system—no integrated chiller is required.  
- **Connectivity**: Ensure Wi‑Fi or reliable phone/Bluetooth coverage at the tub so Yutori can log data and, if needed, run emergency alerts.
