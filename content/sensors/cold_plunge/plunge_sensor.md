**Yutori Labs: Pulse Plunge Sensor**  
Turn any cold plunge into a precise, coach‑guided cold‑exposure practice.

***

## What it is

Pulse Plunge Sensor is a compact Bluetooth temperature sensor plus the Yutori app. Drop it into your existing cold tub or mount it just below the waterline and you get accurate water temperature, automatic session logging, and Live Coach guidance—no chiller or hardware changes required. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/146956071/bedde126-d302-44d9-9794-7ea1ce57fb05/Sauna-Business-Plan.docx)

For plunge use we rely on **temperature only**; the motion channel exists but isn’t central to the product.

## Works with any plunge

- Stock tanks, chest‑freezer conversions, galvanized or plastic tubs.  
- Purpose‑built cold plunge systems from any brand.  
- Indoor or outdoor setups; the sensor’s −40 to 85 °C (−40 to 185 °F) rating and IP68/IP69K enclosure options handle cold water and splashes easily. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/146956071/796a734d-2f0d-4851-bf88-84c9ac432fde/ruuvitag-tech-spec-2023-04.pdf)

If it holds water and you can reach it with your phone, Pulse Plunge Sensor can instrument it.

## What the app does for cold sessions

### Live water temperature

- Real‑time water temperature from the sensor, displayed on your phone and (optionally) Apple Watch.  
- Clear indication of your **usual training range** vs today’s actual temperature, so “45 °F plunge” is a number, not a guess. [ascopubs](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.8544)

### Automatic logging

- Every plunge is logged with:  
  - Duration.  
  - Start and end water temperature, plus the curve in between. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/146956071/bedde126-d302-44d9-9794-7ea1ce57fb05/Sauna-Business-Plan.docx)
  - Peak heart rate and HRV change if you pair a wearable via Apple Health / connectors. [ascopubs](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.8544)
- Data can be written into Apple Health as a workout, alongside your other training and sleep metrics. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/146956071/bedde126-d302-44d9-9794-7ea1ce57fb05/Sauna-Business-Plan.docx)

### Live Coach for cold exposure

With Yutori Premium enabled, Live Coach treats each plunge as a structured set:

- Estimates a **safe and useful time window** using:  
  - Your previous cold sessions (up to 90 days back).  
  - The current water temperature zone (e.g., “cool”, “cold”, “very cold”).  
  - Age, sex, height, and weight, biasing conservatively for higher‑risk profiles. [ascopubs](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.8544)
- Monitors for over‑reach via:  
  - HR ceiling (~85% of age‑predicted max).  
  - “Danger” cold zones where hypothermia risk rises quickly.  
  - Modality‑specific maximum durations. [ascopubs](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.8544)
- Provides plain‑language guidance—“short warm‑up dip”, “strong but reasonable round”, or “wrap this one”—rather than chasing extremes. [ascopubs](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.8544)

Used with a sauna plus sensor, it also understands **contrast sessions**, tracking alternating hot and cold as a single practice and adjusting commentary accordingly. [ascopubs](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.8544)

## Trends and protocols for cold

Over time, Pulse Plunge Sensor plus the app show you how your relationship with cold is changing:

- Average cold plunge duration and typical water temps.  
- “Cold‑shock” peak heart rate in early vs later sessions.  
- How long you can stay in a given temperature band comfortably. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/146956071/bedde126-d302-44d9-9794-7ea1ce57fb05/Sauna-Business-Plan.docx)

From this, Yutori Coach can generate:

- Short, metric‑based summaries (“your average time at 50–55 °F increased from 60 to 120 seconds”). [ascopubs](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.8544)
- Multi‑week cold‑only or contrast protocols with suggested temperatures, durations, weekly frequency, and simple benchmarks. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/146956071/bedde126-d302-44d9-9794-7ea1ce57fb05/Sauna-Business-Plan.docx)

## Hardware details (plunge configuration)

For plunge use we emphasize:

- **Temperature sensing** (TMP117‑class):  
  - Operating range −55 to 150 °C, typical error ±0.1–0.2 °C in the relevant 0–25 °C plunge band. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/146956071/796a734d-2f0d-4851-bf88-84c9ac432fde/ruuvitag-tech-spec-2023-04.pdf)
  - Fine resolution for tracking small changes when your body warms the water.  
- **Enclosure**:  
  - IP68/IP69K polycarbonate housing for submersion and hose‑down cleaning. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/146956071/796a734d-2f0d-4851-bf88-84c9ac432fde/ruuvitag-tech-spec-2023-04.pdf)
- **Battery**:  
  - CR2477T coin cell, user‑replaceable, ~1–2 years typical life at default broadcast rate. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/146956071/796a734d-2f0d-4851-bf88-84c9ac432fde/ruuvitag-tech-spec-2023-04.pdf)
- **Radio**:  
  - BLE 5.0, ~5–20 m indoor/outdoor range depending on walls and your phone antenna. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/146956071/796a734d-2f0d-4851-bf88-84c9ac432fde/ruuvitag-tech-spec-2023-04.pdf)

Recommended placement: clipped or tethered **just below the waterline**, away from direct chiller inlets, so readings reflect what your body actually experiences.

***

## Safety net for cold

Pulse Plunge Sensor also participates in the Yutori safety system:

- Customizable session timers and prompts (e.g., “take your hands out”, “time to come up”).  
- Emergency contacts stored on your device.  
- If a plunge appears to go seriously wrong (e.g., unusual duration + lack of interaction + concerning vitals), the app can escalate with stronger alerts, notify your contacts, and, where supported, initiate an emergency‑call workflow via your device. [ascopubs](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.8544)

As with sauna, this depends on your phone, sensors, and network and should be treated as a **backup layer**, not a medical monitor or replacement for supervision.
