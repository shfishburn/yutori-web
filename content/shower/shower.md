**Yutori Labs: Pulse Shower**  
A clear‑cedar outdoor shower with full copper plumbing, built to live between your sauna and plunge.

***

## A cedar shower that belongs with your sauna

Pulse Shower is a fully built outdoor cedar shower enclosure, designed to match the material and build quality of Pulse Sauna and Pulse Plunge. Vertical cedar, clean lines, and exposed copper piping make it feel like part of the same small bathhouse, not an afterthought.

- Clear Western Red Cedar posts, walls, and trim. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/146956071/bedde126-d302-44d9-9794-7ea1ce57fb05/Sauna-Business-Plan.docx)
- Privacy‑height enclosure with open sky above the shower head.  
- Cedar bench and floor grate over a drain bed, so you stand on warm wood, not plastic or concrete. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/146956071/bedde126-d302-44d9-9794-7ea1ce57fb05/Sauna-Business-Plan.docx)

It gives you a place to rinse before cold, warm up after, or simply take an outdoor shower on summer mornings.

## Real copper, real water, simple hookup

All visible plumbing is **copper**: riser, mixing runs, valves, and the oversized round rain‑head arm, exactly as in the prototype. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/images/146956071/b175ea68-897a-46bf-8d6e-b5c618d8db6d/IMG_3288.jpeg)

- Standard **garden‑hose fitting** feed: connect directly to an exterior hose bib—no house re‑plumbing required.  
- Full copper manifold with individual shutoffs, so a plumber can isolate or service the heater and lines easily.  
- Oversized round rain head in copper finish for a calm, soaking spray.

You get the feel of a built‑in architectural feature, but setup is as simple as dragging a hose over and tightening a fitting.

## Two configurations: with or without heat

### 1) Pulse Shower with Eccotemp heater

For year‑round hot and cold water outdoors.

- Includes an **Eccotemp L5‑class 1.5 GPM Portable Outdoor Tankless Water Heater**, designed for outdoor showers and cabins. [eccotemp](https://www.eccotemp.com/l5-1-5-gpm-portable-outdoor-tankless-water-heater/)
- Hangs on the exterior of the shower on a dedicated mounting panel.  
- Cold feed from your garden hose runs into the heater; hot outlet plus a cold bypass feed a copper mixing valve inside the shower, giving you true hot‑and‑cold control.  
- Runs from a standard 20 lb propane cylinder via included hose and regulator. [eccotemp](https://www.eccotemp.com/l5-1-5-gpm-portable-outdoor-tankless-water-heater/)

This option turns Pulse Shower into a full‑temperature outdoor bathroom that works in any season.

### 2) Pulse Shower (no heater, cold‑only / BYO)

For simple rinses and warmer climates—or if you prefer to supply your own heater.

- Same cedar structure, copper riser, manifold, and rain head.  
- Hose‑bib feed runs directly to the shower line for cold‑only use.  
- Hot side is capped and the mounting panel is prepped so a future Eccotemp‑class heater can be added without modifying the shower.

This is the minimalist version for rinse‑off, post‑plunge cooldown, and summer use.

## How Pulse Shower fits into the system

Pulse Shower is designed to sit within a few steps of Pulse Sauna and Pulse Plunge. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/146956071/bedde126-d302-44d9-9794-7ea1ce57fb05/Sauna-Business-Plan.docx)

- **Before cold**: quick rinse to keep sweat, oils, and debris out of your asnaro plunge, extending water life between changes.  
- **Between hot and cold**: short rinse between sauna rounds without tracking water through the house.  
- **After cold**: comfortable warm shower (with the Eccotemp option) so you can re‑warm and finish the ritual outside.

It doesn’t need sensors or an app of its own; it’s the **reset point** between the instrumented hot and cold parts of your practice, built to the same visual and material standard.
