Here are two draft pages you can adapt. I’ll keep the tone careful, research‑aware, and consistent with Pulse Sauna.

## Page 1: The Science of Heat, Cold, and Light

**Title**  
The Science Behind Pulse Sauna

**Intro**  
This page is a plain‑language overview of what deliberate heat, cold, and red/near‑infrared light appear to do in the body. It is not medical advice, and the studies we reference are often small, short, or focused on specific populations. The goal is to explain *why* we built Pulse Sauna the way we did—not to promise specific outcomes.

### 1. What sauna seems to do

Regular sauna use exposes the body to controlled heat stress. Across multiple observational and interventional studies, a few themes show up:

- **Cardiovascular load similar to light–moderate exercise**  
  Sitting in a hot room increases heart rate, dilates blood vessels, and can reduce blood pressure for some people afterwards. Over time, frequent sauna use has been associated with lower rates of cardiovascular events and all‑cause mortality, although these are associations, not proof of causation.

- **Possible support for exercise performance and recovery**  
  Small trials suggest that post‑exercise sauna blocks can improve markers of endurance capacity and help athletes tolerate training in hotter environments. Other work has looked at soreness and perceived recovery and found modest benefits in some contexts.

- **Hormetic stress and heat shock proteins**  
  Heat exposure activates heat‑shock proteins (HSPs), which help cells manage misfolded proteins and other stresses. There is active interest in HSPs as a mechanism linking heat exposure to cardiometabolic and longevity‑related pathways, but the data are early.

- **Sleep and mood**  
  For many people, the post‑sauna drop in core temperature a few hours later seems to support deeper sleep, and both heat and the ritual itself can reduce perceived stress. These outcomes are largely based on self‑report plus small physiologic studies.

### 2. What cold exposure seems to do

Cold plunges and other forms of deliberate cold exposure work through a different but complementary set of mechanisms:

- **Acute catecholamine surge**  
  Sudden cold can drive a sharp increase in norepinephrine and other stress mediators. Subjectively, this is often experienced as alertness and improved mood.

- **Brown fat and metabolic effects**  
  Repeated cold exposure can increase brown adipose tissue activity and may modestly increase resting energy expenditure in some individuals. The extent and durability of this effect, and its impact on meaningful outcomes like weight or metabolic disease, are still being worked out.

- **Stress resilience and “cold tolerance”**  
  Over time, people often report that their initial shock response diminishes, breathing becomes easier to control, and they can stay in cold water longer with less distress. The physiological meaning of this adaptation is still being clarified, but it likely reflects changes in autonomic regulation and perceived stress.

### 3. Why combine heat and cold (“contrast”)

Alternating hot and cold—sometimes called contrast therapy—layers these stressors:

- Heat drives cardiovascular load, sweating, and HSP activation.  
- Cold drives acute sympathetic activation and brown fat recruitment.  
- The alternation itself trains the vasculature and the nervous system to handle rapid shifts.

Anecdotally, many people find contrast sessions more mood‑elevating and “resetting” than either modality alone. Formal research is relatively sparse, but early markers (inflammation, HRV, subjective stress) point in a promising direction.

### 4. Red and near‑infrared light

Red and near‑infrared light exposure (photobiomodulation) has been studied in a range of contexts:

- **Cellular energy and circulation**  
  Light in the red and NIR bands can interact with mitochondrial chromophores and nitric‑oxide‑related pathways, potentially improving local circulation and cellular energy handling in some tissues.

- **Recovery and pain**  
  Trials in sports, dentistry, and musculoskeletal rehab have reported improvements in pain, swelling, and tissue repair timelines in certain protocols. Results vary by wavelength, dose, and timing, and many studies are small.

- **Skin health**  
  Red light, in particular, has been investigated for its potential to support collagen production and improve fine lines and skin texture in cosmetic settings.

We integrated a sauna‑rated red/NIR panel so these effects, where they exist, can be layered into an already‑scheduled sauna session instead of requiring a separate device and habit.

### 5. How Pulse Sauna fits this research

Pulse Sauna is designed to:

- Make **dose** (temperature × time × frequency) visible and repeatable.  
- Keep people within **conservative guardrails**, especially when adding cold and higher temperatures.  
- Allow users to run protocols that resemble those studied in the literature, while seeing their own markers (heart rate, HRV, tolerance) change over time.

The research on heat, cold, and light is encouraging but not definitive. Different people, with different genetics, medications, and medical histories, will respond differently. We always recommend discussing substantial changes to your routine with your healthcare provider.

## Page 2: How Yutori Coach Works With Pulse Sauna

**Title**  
Yutori Coach: Turning Heat and Cold Into a Structured Practice

**Intro**  
Yutori Coach is the software layer that sits on top of Pulse Sauna and any connected cold‑plunge hardware. It does not replace judgment or medical care. Its job is narrower and more concrete: make each session structured, keep you inside conservative guardrails, and show you how your system is adapting over time.

### 1. During a session: live guidance and safety rails

When you start a sauna, cold plunge, or contrast session, the app begins tracking:

- Modality (sauna, cold plunge, or part of a contrast block).  
- Elapsed time.  
- Temperature from Bluetooth sensors.  
- Heart rate and HRV from your wearable (through Apple Health or Google Health Connect).

From there, the Coach does three things in real time:

1. **Builds a personal timing window**  
   - Looks at your past sessions of that type.  
   - Notes the current temperature “zone” (e.g., lower vs higher sauna temps).  
   - Applies demographic adjustments based on age, sex, height, and weight.  
   - Decides when a session is probably “too short to matter,” “in a useful range,” and “long enough that caution is warranted.”

2. **Monitors for over‑reach**  
   - Checks whether your heart rate has reached roughly 85% of your age‑predicted maximum.  
   - Flags when temperature enters a predefined “danger zone.”  
   - Enforces a hard maximum duration for each modality.

3. **Provides clear, minimal feedback**  
   - Presents a simple state—“Building up,” “You’re in the zone,” or “Time to wrap this”—with a short explanation.  
   - Adds extra language if you’ve hit heart‑rate ceilings, risky temperatures, or absolute time limits.  
   - Recognizes when you’re alternating hot and cold and includes context‑aware notes for contrast sessions.

The intent is not to push you to extremes, but to make it obvious when you are under‑dosing, in a good range, or taking on unnecessary risk.

### 2. After many sessions: patterns, trends, and protocols

Over weeks and months, Yutori Coach aggregates your history into a few key views:

- **Usage pattern**  
  - How many sessions you average per week.  
  - Which days and times you tend to use heat or cold.  
  - Which temperature zones you frequent for each modality.

- **Adaptation markers**  
  - Typical session duration for sauna and cold.  
  - Typical peak sauna temperature and cold‑water temperature.  
  - Trends in HRV, peak heart rate at a given sauna temperature, “cold‑shock” heart rate, and how long you can stay in the plunge comfortably.

- **Narrative summaries and insights**  
  - Short explanations like “your first‑round HRV has trended up over the last 8 weeks” or “your peak heart rate at 180 °F is drifting down.”  
  - Metric‑specific insights tied to concrete numbers, not vague claims.

Based on this structured data, the system can suggest **multi‑week protocols** for:

- Sauna‑only blocks (e.g., for recovery or heat acclimation).  
- Cold‑only blocks (e.g., focusing on cold‑shock tolerance).  
- Contrast sequences (alternating hot and cold), with clear benchmarks and safety notes.

These protocols are optional. You can ignore them and simply let the Coach act as a logbook plus a safety net.

### 3. Emergency alerts: last line of defense, not a guarantee

The Coach also includes an emergency alert system designed to respond when something appears seriously wrong during a session:

- Watches for combinations of factors that suggest trouble, such as time in session, lack of movement or response, and concerning vital signs.  
- If thresholds are met, triggers a staged response:  
  - Local alerts on your device.  
  - Notifications to the contacts you’ve configured.  
  - Where supported, an attempt to initiate an emergency‑call workflow (e.g., 911) via your device.

There are important caveats:

- It depends on your phone, sensors, and network.  
- It is configurable but not infallible.  
- It is not a medical monitoring system or a substitute for supervision when supervision is appropriate.

We’d rather it over‑react than stay silent, but it should always be treated as a backup, not a primary safety system.

### 4. What Yutori Coach is—and is not

Yutori Coach *is*:

- A way to structure heat and cold exposure using time, temperature, and simple physiology.  
- A guardrail system to discourage dangerous extremes.  
- A reflection tool that shows how your nervous system and tolerance are trending.

Yutori Coach is *not*:

- A medical device or diagnostic tool.  
- A guarantee of specific health outcomes.  
- A replacement for medical advice, screening, or common‑sense safety around heat and water.

Used together with Pulse Sauna, the Coach turns a quiet cedar room into something closer to a measured practice—one you can enjoy for how it feels today and for what it appears to change over time.
