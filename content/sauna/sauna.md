**Yutori Labs: Pulse Sauna – Full Product Page (Updated Spec + Safety)**

## Overview

Pulse Sauna is a clear‑cedar backyard sauna that feels like a small forest retreat, built around Saunum’s even heat, integrated red/NIR light, and the Yutori app, which turns your sessions into structured protocols—with an emergency alert system in case something goes seriously wrong.

## Power and Electrical

- **Primary feed**: Single 240 V, 50‑amp RV‑style plug on the sauna, designed to connect to a dedicated 50‑amp RV receptacle at the home’s panel.

- **Circuit**: Homeowner’s electrician installs a 240 V / 50‑amp circuit and RV outlet to local code; no on‑site wiring inside the sauna body is required. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/146956071/a04f56d2-1479-4749-bf43-7206203ee55c/Sauna-Electrical.pptx)

## Yutori App, Coaching, and Emergency System

### Instrumentation

- Yutori Bluetooth sensors (RuuviTag‑based) streaming ambient temperature, humidity, and battery status to the Yutori mobile app. [ascopubs](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.8544)
- Apple Health / Google Health Connect integration to pull heart rate and HRV from compatible wearables. [ascopubs](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.8544)
- Support for sauna, cold plunge, and combined contrast sessions, logged as unified timelines. [ascopubs](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.8544)

### Live Coach (during sessions)

- Computes elapsed time and thermal “zone” based on real‑time temperature and modality (sauna or cold plunge).  
- Builds a personalized exposure window using:  
  - Your historical session durations.  
  - Temperature‑zone evidence from Yutori’s thermal constants.  
  - Demographic factors (age, sex, height, weight) to bias toward conservative dosing when appropriate. [ascopubs](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.8544)
- Applies clear safety guardrails:  
  - HR ceiling at ≈85% of age‑predicted max; alerts when exceeded. [ascopubs](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.8544)
  - Dangerous‑zone temperature detection with immediate “end now” messaging. [ascopubs](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.8544)
  - Absolute maximum duration per modality; reaching it triggers a hard stop recommendation. [ascopubs](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.8544)
- Generates simple guidance states—“not enough”, “optimal”, “too long”—with copy‑ready labels and titles in the app, including contrast‑specific notes when alternating hot and cold. [ascopubs](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.8544)

### Long‑term analysis and protocols

- Aggregates 30–90 days of usage into:  
  - Average durations, peak sauna temps, and cold‑water temps.  
  - Average peak HR and HRV changes per session.  
  - Trends in HRV, peak HR at a given temp, cold‑shock HR, and cold‑tolerance duration. [ascopubs](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.8544)
- Characterizes usage patterns (sessions per week, most common day and time, typical sauna/cold zones). [ascopubs](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.8544)
- Sends this structured `CoachInput` to a Supabase Edge Function (`yutori-coach-analyze`) to generate:  
  - A narrative summary, specific metric‑linked insights, and a simple suggestion. [ascopubs](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.8544)
  - Optional per‑session insights.  
  - Multi‑week sauna, cold, or contrast protocols with weekly focus, frequency, duration, and temperature guidelines plus safety notes. [ascopubs](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.8544)

### Emergency alerts

- Safety system monitors for signs of serious trouble during sauna or plunge sessions, including prolonged lack of movement/response in a high‑risk context (e.g., hot room or cold water), combined with timing and sensor data. [ascopubs](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.8544)
- If thresholds are met, the app can:  
  - Trigger escalating alerts on the user’s phone.  
  - Notify pre‑selected emergency contacts.  
  - Where supported by the user’s device and region, initiate an emergency call workflow (e.g., 911) according to configuration. [ascopubs](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.8544)

> This system is designed as a backup, not a guarantee. It depends on sensor data, device connectivity, and local emergency‑call capabilities and should not be treated as a medical device or a substitute for supervision when appropriate.

## Site & Install Requirements (Client‑Facing)

- **Pad**:  
  - Level, non‑combustible surface; recommended minimum 6'×9' to accommodate the sauna footprint, door swing, and a small landing. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/146956071/2794eb9d-5b93-4548-8217-0867e48a9b29/Saunum-Air-US-ENG-_V_25_12.1_WEB-1.pdf)
  - Surrounding grade sloped away from the door to allow rinse water from the epoxy floor to exit and disperse.  

- **Clearances**:  
  - Side and rear clearances per local building and electrical codes, and per Saunum’s heater clearance requirements. [saunamarketplace](https://saunamarketplace.com/product/saunum-air/)

- **Power**:  
  - Dedicated 240 V, 50‑amp circuit from main panel.  
  - Exterior 50‑amp RV‑style receptacle located near the pad.  
  - Installed by a licensed electrician according to NEC and local code. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/146956071/a04f56d2-1479-4749-bf43-7206203ee55c/Sauna-Electrical.pptx)

- **Connectivity**:  
  - Reliable Wi‑Fi coverage at the sauna location for Saunum control, Yutori syncing, AI coaching, and emergency alert workflows. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/146956071/2794eb9d-5b93-4548-8217-0867e48a9b29/Saunum-Air-US-ENG-_V_25_12.1_WEB-1.pdf)
