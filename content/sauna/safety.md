## Safety & limitations

Pulse Sauna and the Yutori app are designed to make heat and cold exposure easier to structure and safer to explore, but there are important limits to keep in mind:

- **Not a medical device**  
  Pulse Sauna, the Saunum heater, the SaunaMAX Pro light, and the Yutori app are not medical devices and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. They should not replace medical advice, screening, or supervision from your healthcare team. [ascopubs](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.8544)

- **Connectivity‑dependent emergency alerts**  
  The emergency alert system depends on your phone, sensors, and network. If Wi‑Fi or cellular service is poor, if your phone battery is dead, or if permissions are disabled, emergency workflows (including notifications and 911 escalation where supported) may be delayed or unavailable. You should not rely on the system as your sole layer of safety. [ascopubs](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.8544)

- **User configuration and supervision**  
  To work as intended, you must configure emergency contacts and allow the app the necessary notification and health‑data permissions. Children, people with significant cardiovascular or neurological conditions, and anyone advised to avoid heat or cold should only use the sauna or plunge under direct supervision and under medical guidance.

- **Heed your own limits**  
  The Live Coach’s guidance is conservative by design, but it is still an estimate built from population data and your previous usage. If you feel unwell, light‑headed, confused, or distressed, you should end the session immediately and seek help, regardless of what the app is showing.

Used thoughtfully—with an electrician wiring it correctly, Wi‑Fi in place, and reasonable supervision—Pulse Sauna can serve as both a calm cedar room and a well‑instrumented training tool. The safety system is there as a final backstop, not an excuse to ignore common sense.
