## Products

### Saunas
Precision-built heat chambers with embedded sensors that track temperature curves, session duration, and physiological response. Designed for indoor and outdoor use.

### Cold Plunge Tubs
Chiller-powered plunge tubs that hold exact temperatures and sync with the app so every cold exposure is recorded and repeatable.

### Bluetooth Sensors
RuuviTag-based Bluetooth sensors that install in minutes. They stream ambient temperature, humidity, and battery status directly to the Yutori app. Sensors work with any sauna or cold plunge setup — not just Yutori hardware.

## Mobile App

The Yutori app is available for iOS (15.1+) and Android. It connects to sensors via Bluetooth and to Apple Health / Google Health Connect for heart rate and HRV data.

### Core Features

- **Live session tracking**: Real-time temperature graph during sauna and cold plunge sessions
- **Heart rate and HRV**: Streams from Apple Watch or compatible wearables via Apple Health / Health Connect
- **Session history**: Full log of every session with duration, peak/min temperature, HRV trend, and calorie estimates
- **AI coaching**: After each session, the app generates personalized insights and protocol suggestions
- **Contrast sessions**: Track alternating sauna and cold plunge rounds as a single contrast session
- **Safety system**: Configurable emergency alerts with countdown timers, emergency contacts, and auto-escalation
- **Sensor management**: Pair multiple sensors, set target temperatures, and receive ready alerts

### Data and Privacy

- Account data (email, auth tokens) syncs to the cloud for sign-in
- Session and wellness data is processed to show charts, history, and insights
- Emergency contacts are stored locally on the device only
- Users can delete their account and all data from within the app

## Science

Thermal therapy is supported by decades of peer-reviewed research:

- **Recovery**: Heat stimulates HSP70 proteins that accelerate muscle repair
- **Sleep**: Post-sauna temperature drop primes the body for deep slow-wave sleep
- **Mental clarity**: Cold exposure increases norepinephrine, improving focus and mood
- **Cardiovascular**: Regular heat sessions lower resting heart rate and improve arterial function
- **Metabolism**: Brown adipose activation from cold exposure increases caloric burn at rest
- **Immunity**: Hyperthermia stimulates white blood cell production
- **Inflammation**: Contrast therapy reduces systemic inflammation markers (IL-6, CRP)
- **Longevity**: Heat shock proteins and cold adaptation are linked to healthspan markers
